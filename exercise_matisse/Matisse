    <blockquote>What I dream of is an art of balance, of purity and serenity devoid of troubling or depressing subject
        matter - a soothing, calming influence on the mind, rather like a good armchair which provides relaxation from
        physical fatigue.</blockquote>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Henri Matisse</strong> created some of his best-known art in the final decade of his life, and he made it
        from the simplest materials: shapes cut from colorful sheets of paper. He described these “cut-out” works as
        <mark>“drawing with scissors,”</mark> and he used this technique for works of various sizes and subjects.

        This late period of Matisse’s art is showcased in the exhibition <cite>“Henri Matisse: The Cut-Outs”</cite> at the
        <a href="https://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2014/matisse/">Museum of Modern Art in New York</a>. The
        show was organized in collaboration with Tate Modern in London and features approximately 100 cut-outs borrowed
        from museums and private collections around the world. The cut-outs are shown alongside related sketches,
        archival photographs, and samples of the artist’s materials for an overall look at this late, but innovative,
        chapter of Matisse’s life and career.</p>

    <h3>Brush and Canvas, Scissors and Paper</h3>

    Matisse initially used paper cut-outs to plot the design of works in other materials. Arranging and re-arranging
    small forms cut from sheets of paper, he could plan effects of composition, color, and contrast before he painted on
    canvas. In early experiments with this method, he employed cut-outs to visualize the stage sets he was designing for
    theater and ballet productions. In the 1930s paper cut-outs assisted him in creating still-life paintings and in
    finalizing his design for a painted mural at the Barnes Foundation museum in Pennsylvania.
    <br>
    <h3>Jazz and the 1940s: Cut-Outs as Works of Art</h3>

    Matisse initially kept his cut-out technique a secret. In 1943, however, he began to work on <em>Jazz</em>, an illustrated
    book of cut-out designs. <em>Jazz</em> was published in 1947. Its main theme was the circus, and its pages reproduced
    Matisse’s lively paper acrobats, clowns and animals. However, there were also hints of wartime violence in the
    illustrations’ exploding starbursts and falling bodies.

    Coping with the difficulties of old age and illness in the years following World War II, Matisse nonetheless
    produced some of the most vibrant and dynamic works of his career. He lived and worked in southern France, in sunny
    studios in Vence and Nice. Following surgeries for severe intestinal disease, he was confined mostly to his bed and
    to a wheelchair. Working with paper turned out to be an ideal solution to his limited range of movement.</p>
